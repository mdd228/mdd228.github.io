#### Description:  This project is to learn, build and maintain a Portfolio Server

My project is - Portfolio Server - a journey of enlightenment to the objective of mastery of software engineering, server connections, working in groups with GitHub, and building a portfolio server on GitHub.
  
Getting my portfolio pages up fast is important to me because this will be motivation since results will be posted so as to be viewed immediately around the world.
